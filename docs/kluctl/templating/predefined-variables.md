# Predefined Variables

There are multiple variables available which are pre-defined by kluctl. These are:

### args
This is a dictionary of arguments given via command line. It contains every argument defined in
[deployment args](../deployments/deployment-yml.md#args).

### target
This is the target definition of the currently processed target. It contains all values found in the 
[target definition](../kluctl-project/targets), for example `target.name`.

### images
This global object provides the dynamic images features described in [images](../deployments/images.md).
